# Namespace for EIP155 chains

This document describes the syntax and structure of the [EIP155][] namespace,
commonly referred to as the "EVM" namespace for chains using the Ethereum
Virtual Machine. 

## Introduction

[EIP155][] is an Ethereum Improvement Process specifying addressing across
Ethereum-based chains, generalized by [CAIP-2][]. Definition of valid
`references` within that namespace and constraints are deferred to the
[EIP155][] specification, which may be superceded by future EIPs.

## CAIP-2

*For context, see the [CAIP-2][] specification.*

### Context

The chain ID defined in EIP155 is the most widely used chain identifier in the
Ethereum ecosystem known to the authors. It optimizes for uniqueness and its
usage for replay protection has helped it achieve wide adoption. Unique network
IDs can be self-registered in the [ethereum-lists/chains][] registry.

For reference, The format of reference currently specified in EIP155 is an
unsigned integer in decimal representation. Due to length restrictions of the
reference field (32 characters), the largest supported `CHAIN_ID` at time of
writing is `99999999999999999999999999999999`.

### Resolution Method

To resolve a blockchain reference for the EIP155 namespace, make a JSON-RPC
request to a blockchain node with method `eth_chainId`, for example:

```
// Request
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "eth_chainId",
  "params": []
}

// Response
{
  "id": 1,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "0x1"
}
```

The response will return a base-16-encoded integer that should be converted to
base 10 to format an EIP155-compatible blockchain reference.

### Test Cases

This is a list of manually composed examples

```
# Ethereum mainnet
eip155:1

# GÃ¶rli
eip155:5

# Auxilium Network Mainnet
eip155:28945486
```

## CAIP-10

*For context, see the [CAIP-10][] specification.*

### Rationale

While Ethereum "accounts" were the unstated norm in the definition of
[CAIP-10][], there are still some particularities of the syntax that should be
specified for the unfamiliar.  

### Syntax

Ethereum addresses were, historically, case-insensitive and normalized to use
all-lowercase letters (`abcdef`) like most hexadecimal numeric types.  With the
ratification of [EIP55][], however, a particular normalization of lowercase- and
uppercase- `abcdefABCDEF` characters was invented as an efficient form of
checksum. See [EIP55][] for specification.

### Test Cases

```
# Ethereum mainnet (valid/checksummed)
eip155:1:0x22227A31dd842196A246d8f3b775998560eAa61d

# Ethereum mainnet (will not validate in EIP155-conformant systems)
eip155:1:0x22227a31dd842196a246d8f3b775998560eaa61d

# Polygon mainnet (valid/checksummed)
eip155:137:0x0495766cD136138Fc492Dd499B8DC87A92D6685b

# Polygon mainnet (will not validate in EIP155-conformant systems)
eip155:137:0x0495766CD136138FC492DD499B8DC87A92D6685B

```

### Backwards Compatibility

An earlier version of the CAIP-10 schema was defined by appending as suffix the
CAIP-2 chainId delimited by the at sign (@), i.e.
`0x22227A31dd842196A246d8f3b775998560eAa61d@eip155:1` in the above example. This
was changed [Aug 11,
2021](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/commit/0697e26601d30d8e99df17954ed3
e5a1fd59e049) and some systems built against the earlier drafts may present
accounts in this manner.

## CAIP-19

*For context, see the [CAIP-19][] specification.*

### Rationale 

In the Ethereum space, most assets are either a unique on-chain token referenced
by its address, often called a "native token" ([erc20][] tokens being the most
common), or a uniquely-identifiable token within a registry governed by a
contract at a given address ([erc721][] being the most common), often called an
"NFT". An unambiguous and unique representation is easily achieved by using on-
chain address prefixed by CAIP-2 information.

### Syntax

After the CAIP-2 namespace+chainID, a slash defines an `asset_namespace` and an `asset_reference`. 
- In the case of ERC20 tokens, the namespace is `erc20` and the address of the
  smart contract is the reference. 
- In the case of ERC721 tokens, the namespace is `erc721` and the address of the
  smart contract is the reference, with an optional additional identifier for
  the specific token separated from the reference by a "/"

### Examples

```
# DAI Token
eip155:1/erc20:0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f

# REQ Token
eip155:1/erc20:0x8f8221afbb33998d8584a2b05749ba73c37a938a

# CryptoKitties Collectible
eip155:1/erc721:0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d

# CryptoKitties Collectible ID
eip155:1/erc721:0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d/771769

# CryptoCoven.xyz Collectible ID
eip155:1/erc721:0x5180db8f5c931aae63c74266b211f580155ecac8/4663
